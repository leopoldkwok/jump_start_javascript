You can use some to check if one or more of the items in an array conform to a test. some works just like every, but will return true as long as one array item returns true:

var arr, isValid;

arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
isValid = arr.some(function(num) {
	return(num < 2);
}); //isValid is true

In this example, even though just the one number in the array is less than 2, isValid is still true.

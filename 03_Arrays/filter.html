Itâ€™s all well and good to test an array, but what if you want to create a new array with the items that met your criteria? Well, filter does just that. It works like every and some do, except that any item that passes your criteria is copied into a new array:

var arr, filtered;

arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
filtered = arr.filter(function(num) {
	return(num < 5);
});

// filtered now contains [1,2,3,4]

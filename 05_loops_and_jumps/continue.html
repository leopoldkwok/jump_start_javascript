var tasks = [
	{name: 'Buy milk', complete: false},
	{name: 'Trash', complete:false},
	{name: 'Pay bills', complete: true},
	{name: 'Repairs', complete: false},
	{name: 'Plumber', complete: true}
	];

	var firstComplete;

for (var i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
	if(!tasks[i].complete) {
	continue;
	}

	console.log(i, tasks[i].name);
}

This code prints the tasks that are complete, yielding this:

2 'Pay bills'
4 'Plumber'

We choose to print the value of the counter i to demonstrate the effect of using continue on counter incrementation. Notice how it causes the loop to continue, as well as running the end condition to increment the counter.

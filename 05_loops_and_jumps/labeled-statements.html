var i, j;

loop1:
for (i = 0; i<3; i++) {
	//The first for statement is labeled "loop1"
loop2:
for (j=0; j <3; j++) {
	// The second for statement is labeled "loop2"
	if (i == 1 && j ==1 ) {
	continue loop1;

} else {
	console.log("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
		}
	}
}

The key to understanding this code is analyzing continue loop1;. When i and j are both equal to 1, the continue is executed, at which point the code jumps back to the labelled loop1, the counter i is incremented, and execution resumes.

apply

Sometimes, you need to change what a functionâ€™s this keyword points to. The apply method makes it easy by letting you pass an object in as its first parameter that the this keyword will point to:

var person, 
	lastName;

lastName = "Reyes";
person = function() {
	return this.lastName;
};

person(); // returns "Reyes"

person.appl

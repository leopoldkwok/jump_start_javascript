We could write a function that receives a value and then returns another. In order to get something back, we need to make use of the return statement:

function pigLatin(phrase) {
	var words, 
		pigged;

	// Create an array with the words of the phrase
	// we're given by splitting the phrase on the
	// spaces between the words.
	words = phrase.split(" ");

	// Loop over the words array and translate each word to 
	// Pig Latin. Return the trasnlated word so that it
	// gets placed in a new array called "pigged."
	pigged = words.map(function(word) {
		var first, rest

	// Grab the first letter of the word
	first = word.substring(0,1);

	//Grab the rest of the word
	rest = word.substring(1);

	//start the new word with the ending of the old word,
	// and add the first letter of the old word as well as "ay" to the end of it. Return the result of the
	// concatenation so that the map function can add it
	// to the "pigged" array.
	return rest + first + "ay"; 
	});

	// Rebuild the new Pig Latin phrase by rejoining the newly
	// "pigged" words with spaces in between. Return the
	// result so that anyone calling our pigLatin function
	// can actually get the new Pig Latin version of their
	// phrase.
	return pigged.join(" ");
}

var pl = pigLatin("tonight you belong to me");

 // returns "onighttay ouyay elongbay otay emay" into pl

 Now, whenever we want to translate a phrase, we just need to pass it into our pigLatin function and we have our translation. Simple!

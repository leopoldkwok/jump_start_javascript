When you define a function, you can define a list of arguments that it will receive. In doing so, youâ€™re declaring variables for use within the scope of that function. In other words, those variables can only be used inside that function. For example:

function person(firstName, lastName, age) {
	alert(firstName);
	alert(lastName);
	alert(age);
}

person("John", "Doe", 44);

Our function, named person, receives three arguments, firstName, lastName, and age. When the function is called on the last line of our example, three values are passed through its parentheses: "John", "Doe", and 44. Inside the function, we take those three values and alert them one after the other.

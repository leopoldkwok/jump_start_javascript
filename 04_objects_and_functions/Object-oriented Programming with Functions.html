Object-oriented Programming with Functions

Unfortunately, providing an in-depth, comprehensive explanation of what object- oriented programming (OOP) is falls outside the scope of this short book. But the basic gist of it is that OOP is a programming style that lets you represent real-world items as objects in your code. An object can represent a physical element such as a person or fruit, or something more abstract such as a bank account or network connection. The object stores data (called properties) and functions (called methods), the latter acting on the data. So an object representing a bank account may have properties such as account number, balance, and overdraft limit, and methods such as deposit and withdraw.
For anyone familiar with traditional class-based OOP, JavaScript is a class-less prototypal programming language where objects inherit from other objects instead of classes. JavaScript uses functions as classes but has no class statement. Instead, any function can act as a class and new instances of that class can be created using the new keyword:

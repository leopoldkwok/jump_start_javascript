A function is a way to group a set of operations, give it a name, and then be able to call it as often as you wish. Here’s a simple function:

function sayHello() {
	alert("Hello, world!");
}


By calling this simple function, you can cause an alert to appear with the message, "Hello, world!". Once we’ve defined sayHello (as we did above), running (or executing or calling) it is very simple; you just write its name followed by paren- theses:

sayHello();

The reason for the parentheses is so that you can pass values as arguments into your function.Forexample,ratherthanourfunctionsaying"Hello, world!",we could have it say something else:

function sayHello(msg) {
	alert(msg);
}

Now when we call sayHello, we can pass in our own message:

sayHello("Howdy, y'all!");

Doing this calls the sayHello function and passes in "Howdy, y’all!" as the first argument. If you look at our sayHello function, we’ve specified a variable named msg as the first argument, so inside sayHello, msg will contain the value that was passedintothefunction;inthiscase,"Howdy, y’all!"Wethenhandthatvariable over to alert and voilà!

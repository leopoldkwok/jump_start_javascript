A function is a way to group a set of operations, give it a name, and then be able to call it as often as you wish. Here’s a simple function:

function sayHello() {
	alert("Hello, world!");
}


By calling this simple function, you can cause an alert to appear with the message, "Hello, world!". Once we’ve defined sayHello (as we did above), running (or executing or calling) it is very simple; you just write its name followed by paren- theses:

sayHello();

The reason for the parentheses is so that you can pass values as arguments into your function.Forexample,ratherthanourfunctionsaying"Hello, world!",wecould have it say something else:

Creating an Object
As with arrays, there are a couple of ways to create objects, and, just like arrays, one is preferred over the other. So even though you can do this:

var myObject = new Object();

it is much better to do this:

var myObject = {};

The latter is simpler, safer, and therefore preferable.

Array() can be overwritten for malicious purposes. So can Object(), which is why it's safer to use the object literal notation {} as it's unable to be overwritten. The object literal represents a new, empty object.

Whereas in an array, values are simply added and accessed by index, objects use a key/value pair system. These two distinct ways of storing values make it fairly simple when choosing between arrays or objects for your data storage and retrieval needs. For example:

var lotteryNumbers, profile;

lotteryNumbers = [4,8,15,16,23,42];
profile = {
	firstName: "Hugo",
	lastName: "Reyes",
	flight: "Oceanic 815",
	car: "Camaro"
}

Note how the lotteryNumbers array lends itself well to storing the sequence of lottery numbers, while the profile object is perfect for storing the key/value pairs of a person's (Hugo's) profile.

After you’ve declared your object, however, you can still add key/value pairs to it in a couple of ways. When looking at the chapter on arrays, we touched on named indices, which can be used to create associative arrays, though objects are better suited to the task. Here’s an example of that:

var obj = {};

obj["firstName"] = "Hugo";
obj["lastName"] = "Reyes";

This is known as bracket notation. The alternative and more common syntax is dot notation. Here's an example:

var obj = {};

obj.firstName = "Hugo";
obj.lastName = "Reyes";

Dot notation is simpler than bracket notation; however, there are certain tasks that can only be done with bracket notation. For example, you can use a variable inside the brackets, which can't be done using dot notation. Bracket notation also supports strings containing spaces and other characters that are invalid in dot notation.

Reading a value from an object can also be accomplished using bracket or dot notation:

var obj = {};

obj.firstName = "Hugo";
obj.lastName = "Reyes";
alert("Hello, my name is " + obj.firstName + " " + obj.lastName + ".");

Unlike arrays, it’s not possible to read the contents of an object using a numeric index. The only type of index that can be used is a named one:

var obj = {};

obj.firstName = "Hugo";

obj[0]; // returns undefined
obj["firstName"]; // returns "Hugo"
obj.firstName; // returns "Hugo"

Nesting objects can be very helpful in organizing your data:

var person;

person = {
	name: {
		first: "Hugo",
		last: "Reyes"
	}
};

person.name.first; // returns "Hugo"
person.name.last; // returns "Reyes"

It’s also possible to assign objects:

var person;

person = {};
person.name = {};
person.name.first = "Hugo";
person.name.last = "Reyes";

Namespacing through Nested Objects
If you’re at all familiar with modern programming languages, you’ve heard of namespacing. Essentially, it’s a better way to organize code by putting it into nested buckets, or namespaces.

Of course, in order for this namespace to exist, we must first nest the appropriate objects:

var Project = {
	Strings: {
	Warnings: {}
	}
};


Here we use the OR operator (||) to test whether or not Project is defined. If Project is already defined, it assigns its value to Project and nothing is changed. If it isn’t, JavaScript assigns what’s on the right-hand side of || to the Project variable

Prototype Chain

All objects have a prototype. So, what’s a prototype? It’s an object from which other objects inherit properties.

Looping over an Object

Looping over an object isn’t as simple as looping over an array. With an array, you simply increment an index value and use that to step through the array. With objects, there is no index value. Objects are collections of key/value pairs, so you need to step through them differently:

var data, 
	key;

data = {
	firstName: "James",
	lastName: "Kirk",
	occupation: "Captain"
	};

for (key in data) {
	alert(key + " is " + data[key]);
	} 

In this example, we use a for ... in loop. We give it a variable (in this case, key) that will be used to hold the key as it steps through the object, and an object to step over (in this case, data). For each key/value pair inside data, the loop will assign the key to our variable named key. Inside the body of the loop, we can use the key to plug into our object to access its associated value: data[key]. That’s the equivalent of writing data["firstName"], and on a subsequent pass, data["lastName"], and so on.

There is one catch, though. Since objects inherit from objects, the loop may start returning key/value pairs from further up the prototype chain. To prevent this, we need to add something to our loop:

var data, 
	key;

data = {
	firstName: "James",
	lastName: "Kirk",
	occupation: "Captain"
};

for (key in data) {
	if(data.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
	alert(key + " is " + data[key]);
	}
}

The hasOwnProperty method makes sure that the key we’re using belongs to the object in question and doesn't originate further up the prototype chain. If it returns true, we can proceed with our operation. Otherwise, we ignore it.
